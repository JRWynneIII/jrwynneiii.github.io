        <p>I am currently working on a bachelor’s degree in computer science. Recently, I’ve been </p>

<p>expanding my experience with methods for parallel programming and utilizing GPUs for </p>

<p>code acceleration though an internship at Oak Ridge National Lab at the OLCF. As part </p>

<p>of my internship I’ve written code that I ran on the Titan supercomputer and written </p>

<p>three tutorials that go with it. These tutorials show the parallelization of code using MPI, </p>

<p>and OpenMP, OpenACC, CUDA, and Thrust. The tutorials I developed were a Monte Carlo </p>

<p>integrator that calculates pi, and a code that will generate the Mandelbrot set in parallel. My </p>

<p>next project is a MAGMA-related tutorial to Fortran and C. This tutorial will also encompass other linear </p>

<p>algebra libraries, mainly CULA and LAPACK. </p>

<p>Recently I gave a seminar at the University of Tennessee on the subject of </p>

<p>accelerating serial code for the GPU. I’ve also given talks to groups of </p>

<p>high school and early college students about the basic principles of High Performance </p>

<p>Computing. In my free time, I’ve built two 4-node clusters. I’ve always been interested in </p>

<p>computing but by building the first cluster, it pushed me to research more into and focus my </p>

<p>interest into HPC related areas.</p>
