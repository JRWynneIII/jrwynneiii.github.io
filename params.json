{"name":"James R Wynne III: GPU Jake","tagline":"","body":"I am working on a bachelor’s degree in computational science. Recently I’ve been \r\n\r\nexpanding my experience with methods for parallel programming and utilizing GPUs for\r\n\r\ncode acceleration though an internship at Oak Ridge National Lab at the OLCF. As part\r\n\r\nof my internship I’ve written code that I ran on the Titan supercomputer and written \r\n\r\nthree tutorials that go with it. These tutorials show the parallelization of code using MPI,\r\n\r\nand OpenMP, OpenACC, CUDA, and Thrust. The tutorials I developed were a Monte Carlo \r\n\r\nintegrator that calculates pi, and a code that will generate the Mandelbrot set in parallel. My\r\n\r\nnext project is a MAGMA-related tutorial to Fortran. \r\n\r\nRecently I gave a seminar at the University of Tennessee on the subject of \r\n\r\naccelerating serial code for the GPU, as you are aware. I’ve also given talks to groups of \r\n\r\nhigh school and early college students about the basic principles of High Performance \r\n\r\nComputing. In my free time, I’ve built two 4-node clusters. I’ve always been interested in \r\n\r\ncomputing but by building the first cluster, it pushed me to research more into and focus my \r\n\r\ninterest into HPC related areas.\r\n\r\n I’m a good problem solver, and a dedicated, hard worker.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
